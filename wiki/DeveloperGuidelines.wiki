#summary Coding guidelines for code contributions.

= Introduction =

This page is to list some of the more important guidelines for developers contributing code to osmdroid.  This is not intended to strictly enforce a particular style - more to keep the code internally consistent.


== General guidelines ==

 * Use tabs for intending
 * Make variables final where possible
 * Prefix member variables with m
 * Prefix method arguments with a

== Guidelines for osmdroid-android project ==

 * Use org.slf4j.Logger, not android.util.Log
 * Use org.andnav.osm.!ResourceProxy, not Context.getResource

Those are the main less obvious guidelines.  In general, try and follow the existing style.
