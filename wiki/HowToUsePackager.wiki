== Why you might want to use it ==

You can use the tile packager in order to load tiles onto your device so that you will not need an internet connection when running an application that uses osmdroid.


== Determining the map area ==

The first thing you need to do is to decide the area that you want to download. This means determining the coordinates. The easiest way is to go to <a hef="http://openstreetmaps.org/">!OpenStreetMap.org</a>, view the area that you want to export, and then click on the "Export" tab. You can then click the "Manually select a different area" link and chose your area by dragging an area over it. The coordinates are displayed in the box.
