== Why you might want to use it ==

You can use the tile packager in order to load tiles onto your device so that you will not need an internet connection when running an application that uses osmdroid.


== Determining the map area ==

The first thing you need to do is to decide the area that you want to download. This means determining the coordinates. The easiest way is to go to <a hef="http://openstreetmaps.org/">!OpenStreetMap.org</a>, view the area that you want to download, and then click on the "Export" tab. You can then click the "Manually select a different area" link and choose your area by dragging a box over it. The coordinates are displayed in the "Area to Export" box.

Below is an example of choosing the lovely town of Haarlem in The Netherlands.
This shows that the coordinates are:<br />
North: 52.4244<br />
East: 4.6746<br />
South: 52.3388<br />
West: 4.5949
