This page explains how to use osmdroid in your own application.

== Using it ==

Now you can just use !OpenStreetMapView in much the same way as <a href="http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/reference/com/google/android/maps/MapView.html">!MapView</a>.
You can also use any overlays that you wish from the org.andnav.osm.views.overlay package. There are many samples activities included with osmdroid.
