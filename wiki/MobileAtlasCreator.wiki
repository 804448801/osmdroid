Create a tile set suitable for AndNav.
The suffixes will need to be changed.
If the purpose for the extra extension at the end of the filename 
is to prevent the tree from being visited by certain media activities
there is a convention to place a file (may be empty) named .nomedia is in the directory.
(This can also be programmatically accommodated in osmdroid.)
{{{
find . -name '*.andnav' | while read name; do mv ${name} ${name%.andnav}; done
}}}
Then copy the tree onto the android device.
For example {{{adb push ./Mapnik /sdcard/osmdroid/tiles/Mapnik/}}}
