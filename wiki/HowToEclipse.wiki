#summary How to compile and run using Eclipse
#labels Phase-Deploy

== Install the Android SDK == 
Install the Android SDK, including Eclipse & the Android Eclipse 
extension, as described in the official documentation: 
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html 
Make sure to install at least the Android SDK Platform 1.5 (API 3). 
Make sure to create an Android Virtual Machine by selecting the following: 
 * Window -> Android SDK and AVD Manager 
 * select Virtual Devices -> New... 
 * enter: 
   * Name: avm15 
   * Target: Android 1.5 - API Level 3 
   * SD Card: Size: 1024 MiB (this is important) 
 * click Create AVD 
After this is done, set the ANDROID_SDK_DIR classpath variable in 
Eclipse, by selecting: 
 * Window -> Preferences... 
 * Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables 
 * click New... 
 * enter: 
   * Name: ANDROID_SDK_LIB 
   * Path: /path/to/.../android-sdk-linux_86/platforms/android-3/android.jar 
 * click OK 
 * click OK 
== Check out the sources == 
Check out the osmdroid sources as describe here: 
http://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/source/checkout 
the quick steps are: 
<pre> 
svn checkout http://osmdroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ osmdroid-read-only 
</pre> 
== Import ==
In Eclipse, right-click on the Package area, and select the following: 
 * click on Import... 
 * select General -> Existing Projects into Workspace 
 * click Next 
 * click Browse... 
 * select the checked out projects' directories
=== osmdroid-android ===
=== OSMMapTilePackager ===
=== OpenStreetMapViewer ===
 * click OK 
 * click Finish 
== Compile ==
The projects presume an ant build file.
Eclipse typically doesn't use and ant build so you will need to make some adjustments.

== Try out OpenStreetMapViewer in an emulator == 
First, start an emulator by executing the following from within Eclipse: 
 * Window -> Android SDK and AVD Manager 
 * select your virtual device 
 * click Start... 
 * wait for the emulator to start (takes a long time) 
then, right-clik the OpenStreetMap project, and select: 
 * Run As -> Android Application 
and see the application downloaded to the emulator & run
